Challenge 1: Code analysis

=============


The first step done, in this offline test, was to check ramda documentation in https://ramdajs.com/.

I created a project folder named "offlineTest", where I installed ramda dependency with npm install ramda. (npm and nodejs were already installed in the computer).

I use the "vscode" code editor and inside of it, I initialized the repository.

Then I created a .gitignore file, to ignore the "/node_modules/" folder.

In the project folder I created the "/src/" folder, where I  created the main file, which will have the attached code, in a file named app.js.
